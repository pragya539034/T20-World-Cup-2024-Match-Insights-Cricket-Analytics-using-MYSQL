> # Objective
> This project demonstrates a T20 World Cup 2024 Match Insights System built using MySQL.
It contains queries for analyzing match data, team performance, toss outcomes, player awards, and venue-based insights — helping to uncover trends such as winning patterns, chasing success rates, and impact of toss decisions on match results.

># # Tools Used
> - MySQL – for data storage, querying, and analysis
> - CSV File – T20 World Cup 2024 match dataset (t20wc.csv)

> # Steps Included
> Data Import

> o Imported the T20 World Cup 2024 dataset into MySQL as the table t20wc.

> o Verified that all match attributes (teams, scores, venues, players) were properly loaded.

> o Ensured data consistency and correct data types for numeric and text fields.

> Data Exploration

> o Checked total number of matches, unique venues, and team participation.

> o Verified match distribution across stages (Group, Super 8, Semi-final, Final).

> o Identified missing or null values for player and performance fields.

>  # Key Insights
